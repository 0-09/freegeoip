Can't continue providing the online service at the moment. I apologize for
any disruption but have higher priorities for now.

The software will remain free, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip),
pre-compiled binaries at the [releases](https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip/releases)
page and Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiorix/freegeoip/).

Cheers
