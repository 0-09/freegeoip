It's been a long time since I wanted to create a blog for the freegeoip.

Due to the increasing adoption over the last few years and the recent updates
of the site and infrastructure, I felt like it's time to do so. Thus, will try
to update as much as possible regarding service features, the current
infrastructure, donations, etc...
